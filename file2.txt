Sometimes you picture me
I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me, I can't hear
What you've said
You say - go slow
I fall behind
The second hand unwinds

Run and tell all of the angels
This could take all night
Think I need a devil to help me get things right
Hook me up a new revolution
'Cause this one is a lie
We sat around laughin' and watched the last one die
